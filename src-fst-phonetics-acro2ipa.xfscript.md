Phonological ACRO converter for Julev SÃ¡mi
==========================================

Converts ACROS to IPA. Intended for use with TTS.
`>` marks undlying morpheme boundary between lemma and inflectional suffix,
`:` is the same, but in the surface orthography. The idea is that the
pronunciation of the last letter sound (like `e:` when reading the letter
`P`) can be different when followed by a case ending compared to when not.
If that is not true, the system can be simplified.

Default, letter by letter pronunciation
