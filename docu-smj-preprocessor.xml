        <p>Within the Xerox framework, this is done with the <em>tokenize</em> tool. The code itself is written as a set of regular expressions, and the source file (tok.txt) is compiled by xfst.</p>
        <p>The tok.txt file is copied from an earlier version of the sme tok.txt file, and has not yet (030311) been updated according to the last sme developments.</p>

        <title>Spell relaxation of æ/ä, ø/ö</title>
        <p>This is a feature common to Lule and Southern Sami, not to be found in Northern Sami. The letter æ/ä and ø/ö are used interchangeably in Norway and Sweden. The parser should thus accept any version of them.</p>
        <p>The xfst file to handle this is short, it consists of one line:</p>
        <p>æ (->) ä, ø (->) ö ;</p>
        <p>The line says that æ may optionally be replaced by ä and that ø may optionally be replaced with ö.</p>

        <title>Initial capitalization</title>
        <p>This works like the Northern Sami file, cf. <link href="docu-sme-preprocessor.html#ini" >the documentation for Northern Sami initial capitalization</link>. The content of the file is slightly different, since the letter repertoire is different as well.</p>
