          <title>Obsolete: The tokenizer file tok.txt</title>

          <p>Just as for North Sámi, the Lule Saami preprocessing was
          earlier done with the Xerox <em>tokenize</em> tool and the
          language-specific file tok.txt. The code itself is written as a set
          of regular expressions, and the source file (tok.txt) was compiled
          by xfst. As explained for the sme preprocessing, this approach was
          replaced by a preprocessor script, written in perl,
          <code>gt/script/preprocess</code>. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>The current preprocessor</title>

          <p>Preprocessing is done by the perl script
          <code>gt/script/preprocess</code>, which is language-independent.
          The script is documented <a
          href="../../ling/preprocessor.html">here</a>. The language dependent
          part of the script shall be done via the file <code>smj/bin/abbr.txt</code></p>

          <title>Handling abbreviations</title>


          <p>Lule Saami abbreviations are handled as for North Saami.</p>

      <section>
        <title>Spell relaxation of æ/ä, ø/ö</title>

        <p>This is a feature common to Lule and South Sami, not to be found
        in North Sami. The letter æ/ä and ø/ö are used interchangeably in
        Norway and Sweden. The parser accepts any version of
        them.</p>

        <p>The xfst file to handle this is the language-independent
        <a href="https://victorio.uit.no/langtech/trunk/gt/common/src/spellrelax.regex">spellrelax.regex</a>.
        It contains rules like:</p>

        <source>ń (-&gt;) ñ, ŋ (-&gt;) ñ, æ (-&gt;) ä, ø (-&gt;) ö ;</source>

        <p>The line says that æ may optionally be replaced by ä and that ø may
        optionally be replaced with ö, and the same for the different ways of
        writing ŋ.</p>
        <p>
        We plan to make parts of the spellrelax file language dependent.

        <title>Initial capitalization</title>

        <p>There is a language independent <a href="https://victorio.uit.no/langtech/trunk/gt/common/src/inituppercase.regex">inituppercase.regex</a> file. Cf. <a
        href="../sme/docu-sme-preprocessor.html#ini">the documentation for
        initial capitalization</a> written for North Saami.</p>
