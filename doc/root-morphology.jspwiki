!!Tags for originating language
The following tags are used to guide conversion to IPA: loan words
and foreign names are usually pronounced (approximately) as in the
originating (majority) language. Instead of trying to identify the
correct pronounciation based on fonotactics (orthotactics actually),
we tag all words that can't be correctly transcribed using the SME
transcriber with source language codes. Once tagged, it is possible
to split the lexical transducer in smaller ones according to langu-
age, and apply different IPA conversion to each of them.
The principle of tagging is that we only tag to the extent needed,
and following a priority:
# any untagged word is pronounced with SME orthographic conventions
# NNO and NOB have identical pronounciation, NNO is only used if
  different in spelling from NOB
# SWE has mostly the same pronounciation as NOB, and is only used
  if different in spelling from NOB
# Occasionally even SME (the default) may be tagged, to block other
  languages from being specified, mainly during semi-automatic
  language tagging sessions
All in all, we want to get as much correctly transcribed to IPA
with as little work as possible. On the other hand, if more words
are tagged than strictly needed, this should pose no problem as
long as the IPA conversion is correct - at least some words will
get the same pronounciation whether read as SME or NOB/NNO/SWE.
 * +OLang/SME - North Sámi
 * +OLang/SMA - South Sámi
 * +OLang/FIN - Finnish
 * +OLang/SWE - Swedish
 * +OLang/NOB - Norw. bokmål
 * +OLang/NNO - Norw. nynorsk
 * +OLang/ENG - English
 * +OLang/UND - Undefined





!!Flag diacritics
We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
 | @P.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @D.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 | @C.NeedNoun@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised

For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
do no harm.
 | @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 | @D.CmpPref.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 | @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
 | @D.CmpLast.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering R
 | @D.CmpNone.TRUE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 | @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 | @U.CmpNone.TRUE@ | Combines with the two previous ones to block compounding
 | @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 | @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.
 | @U.CmpHyph.FALSE@ | Flag to control hyphenated compounds like proper nouns
 | @U.CmpHyph.TRUE@ | Flag to control hyphenated compounds like proper nouns
 | @C.CmpHyph@ | Flag to control hyphenated compounds like proper nouns

Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
given the proper use of these flags.
 | @U.Cap.Obl@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 | @U.Cap.Opt@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 | @P.Px.add@	 | Giving possibility for Px-suffixes (all except from Nom 3.p)
 | @R.Px.add@	 | Requiring P.Px.add-flag for Px-suffixes (all except from Nom 3.p)
 | @P.Nom3Px.add@ |  Giving possibility for Px-suffixes Nom 3.p
 | @R.Nom3Px.add@ | Requiring P.Nom3Px.add flag for Px-suffixes Nom 3.p




 * __LEXICON ProperNoun   __ 

!!!Lexicon ENDLEX
And this is the ENDLEX of everything:
{{{
 @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@@D.CmpPref.TRUE@@D.NeedNoun.ON@ # ;
}}}
The {{@D.CmpOnly.FALSE@}} flag diacritic is ued to disallow words tagged
with +CmpNP/Only to end here.
The {{@D.NeedNoun.ON@}} flag diacritic is used to block illegal compounds.
