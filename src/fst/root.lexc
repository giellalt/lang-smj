!! !Compounding tags

!! The tags are of the following form:
!! * __+CmpNP/xxx__ - Normative (N), Position (P), ie. the tag describes what
!!                    position the tagged word can be in in a compound
!! * __+CmpN/xxx__  - Normative (N) __form__ ie. the tag describes what
!!                    form the tagged word should use when making compounds
!! * __+Cmp/xxx__   - Descriptive compounding tags, ie. tags that''describes''
!!                    what form a word actually is using in a compound

!! Normative/prescriptive compounding tags:
!! (to govern compound behaviour for the speller, ie. what a compound SHOULD BE)

!! The first part of the component may be ..
+CmpN/Sg          !!≈ * @CODE@ = Singular
+CmpN/SgN         !!≈ * @CODE@ = Singular Nominative
+CmpN/SgG         !!≈ * @CODE@ = Singular Genitive
+CmpN/PlG         !!≈ * @CODE@ = Plural Genitive
+CmpN/Attr        !!≈ * @CODE@ = Attributive

! This part of the component can ..
+CmpNP/All       !!≈ * @CODE@ - ... be in all positions, __default__, this tag does not have to be written
+CmpNP/First     !!≈ * @CODE@ - ... only be first part in a compound or alone
+CmpNP/Pref      !!≈ * @CODE@ - ... only __first__ part in a compound, NEVER alone
+CmpNP/Last      !!≈ * @CODE@ - ... only be last part in a compound or alone
+CmpNP/Suff      !!≈ * @CODE@ - ... only __last__ part in a compound, NEVER alone
+CmpNP/None      !!≈ * @CODE@ - ... not take part in compounds
+CmpNP/Only      !!≈ * @CODE@ - ... only be part of a compound, i.e. can never
                 !!                 be used alone, but can appear in any position

! The second part of the compound may require that the previous (left part) is (and thus overrides the regular CmpN tags):
+CmpN/SgLeft     !!≈ * @CODE@  Singular to the left
+CmpN/SgNomLeft  !!≈ * @CODE@  Singular nominative to the left
+CmpN/SgGenLeft  !!≈ * @CODE@  Singular genitive to the left
+CmpN/PlGenLeft  !!≈ * @CODE@  Plural genitive to the left

! But these tags can again be overriden by the first word in a compound, if this part of the compound is tagged with a def tag:
+CmpN/Def        !!≈ * @CODE@  Left override
+CmpN/DefSgGen   !!≈ * @CODE@  Overrides left tag, requires SgGen form
+CmpN/DefPlGen   !!≈ * @CODE@  Overrides left tag, requires PlGen form

! Descriptive compounding tags:

! Tags for compound analysis - this is what a compound actually is:
 +Cmp/Sg       !!≈ * __@CODE@__  Singular
 +Cmp/SgNom    !!≈ * __@CODE@__  Singular Nominative
 +Cmp/SgGen    !!≈ * __@CODE@__  Singular Genitive
 +Cmp/PlGen    !!≈ * __@CODE@__  Plural Genitiv
 +Cmp/PlNom    !!≈ * __@CODE@__  Plural Nominative
 +Cmp/Attr     !!≈ * __@CODE@__  Attribute
 +Cmp          !!≈ * __@CODE@__  Dynamic compound - this tag should always be part of a
               !!                dynamic compound.
               !!                It is important for Apertium, and useful in other cases as well.
 +Cmp/SplitR   !!≈ * __@CODE@__  This is a split compound with the other part to the right:
               !!                "Arbeids- og inkluderingsdepartementet" => Arbeids- = +Cmp/SplitR
 +Cmp/SplitL   !!≈ * __@CODE@__  This is a split compound with the other part to the left
 +Cmp/Sh       !!≈ * __@CODE@__  testing ShCmp

!! !!Derivation tags

!! The following tags are used to describe the dynamic derivational system in
!! Lule Sámi as encoded in this lexical description. The tags are classified
!! according to a positional system, where each tag can be in one and only one
!! position, and can only combine with tags from an earlier / lower position.
!! This is done to avoid possible overgeneration in the derivational system.

!! !!Tags for originating language
!!
!! The following tags are used to guide conversion to IPA: loan words
!! and foreign names are usually pronounced (approximately) as in the
!! originating (majority) language. Instead of trying to identify the
!! correct pronunciation based on phonotactics (orthotactics actually),
!! we tag all words that can't be correctly transcribed using the SME
!! transcriber with source language codes. Once tagged, it is possible
!! to split the lexical transducer in smaller ones according to langu-
!! age, and apply different IPA conversion to each of them.
!!
!! The principle of tagging is that we only tag to the extent needed,
!! and following a priority:
!! # any untagged word is pronounced with SME orthographic conventions
!! # NNO and NOB have identical pronunciation, NNO is only used if
!!   different in spelling from NOB
!! # SWE has mostly the same pronunciation as NOB, and is only used
!!   if different in spelling from NOB
!! # Occasionally even SME (the default) may be tagged, to block other
!!   languages from being specified, mainly during semi-automatic
!!   language tagging sessions
!!
!! All in all, we want to get as much correctly transcribed to IPA
!! with as little work as possible. On the other hand, if more words
!! are tagged than strictly needed, this should pose no problem as
!! long as the IPA conversion is correct - at least some words will
!! get the same pronunciation whether read as SME or NOB/NNO/SWE.

!! !!Flag diacritics

!!
!! For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
!! to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
!! handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
!! do no harm.
 @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 @D.CmpPref.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
 @D.CmpLast.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Block such words from entering R
 @D.CmpNone.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 @U.CmpNone.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Combines with the two previous ones to block compounding
 @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.
 @U.CmpHyph.FALSE@ !!≈ | @CODE@ | Flag to control hyphenated compounds like proper nouns
 @U.CmpHyph.TRUE@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Flag to control hyphenated compounds like proper nouns
 @C.CmpHyph@       !!≈ | @CODE@ | Flag to control hyphenated compounds like proper nouns
!!
!! Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
!! nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
!! these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
!! given the proper use of these flags.
 @U.Cap.Obl@        !!≈ | @CODE@ | Disallow downcasing of names when not derived: Deatnu
 @U.Cap.Opt@        !!≈ | @CODE@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 @P.Px.add@	    !!≈ | @CODE@ | Giving possibility for Px-suffixes (all except from Nom 3.p)
 @R.Px.add@	    !!≈ | @CODE@ | Requiring P.Px.add-flag for Px-suffixes (all except from Nom 3.p)
 @P.Nom3Px.add@  !!≈ | @CODE@ |  Giving possibility for Px-suffixes Nom 3.p
 @R.Nom3Px.add@  !!≈ | @CODE@ | Requiring P.Nom3Px.add flag for Px-suffixes Nom 3.p
