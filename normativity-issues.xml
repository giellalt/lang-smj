      <title>Background</title>

      <p>The immediate background for this list is the meeting of the Lule
      Sámi language board meeting. The list will be relevant also after this
      meeting, though. It is a key document to the normativity issued faced by
      the sámi spellchecker program, and lists open normativity issues.</p>

      <title>Even and contracted stemtypes in nom. and gen./acc. when joined
      with pos. suffix</title>

      <p>The normative grammars are far from precise in this issue with
      respect to stem-vowel change and central consonant gradation in each
      case.</p>

      <title>Loan word intergration</title>

      <p>What policy should be followed here? There are no normative decisions
      made. The writers of Sámásta say that principles have been developed
      over time, but the practice is unstable and there seems to be a whole
      lot of confusion (s. 272 ff.). The book gives some suggestions of how to
      incorporate loanwords, but there hasn't obviously been any normative
      organ involved.</p>
