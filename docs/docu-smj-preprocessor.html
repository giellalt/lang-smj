Preprocessing the input
=======================

Introduction

Tokenizing
----------

### Obsolete: The tokenizer file tok.txt

Just as for North Sámi, the Lule Saami preprocessing was earlier done
with the Xerox *tokenize* tool and the language-specific file tok.txt.
The code itself is written as a set of regular expressions, and the
source file (tok.txt) was compiled by xfst. As explained for the sme
preprocessing, this approach was replaced by a preprocessor script,
written in perl, `gt/script/preprocess`.

### The current preprocessor

Preprocessing is done by the perl script `gt/script/preprocess`, which
is language-independent. The script is documented
[here](../../ling/preprocessor.html). The language dependent part of the
script shall be done via the file `smj/bin/abbr.txt`

### Handling abbreviations

Lule Saami abbreviations are handled as for North Saami.

Spell relaxation of æ/ä, ø/ö
----------------------------

This is a feature common to Lule and South Sami, not to be found in
North Sami. The letter æ/ä and ø/ö are used interchangeably in Norway
and Sweden. The parser accepts any version of them.

The xfst file to handle this is the language-independent
[spellrelax.regex](https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/gt/common/src/spellrelax.regex).
It contains rules like:

    ń (->) ñ, ŋ (->) ñ, æ (->) ä, ø (->) ö ;

The line says that æ may optionally be replaced by ä and that ø may
optionally be replaced with ö, and the same for the different ways of
writing ŋ.

We plan to make parts of the spellrelax file language dependent.

Initial capitalization
----------------------

There is a language independent
[inituppercase.regex](https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/gt/common/src/inituppercase.regex)
file. Cf. [the documentation for initial
capitalization](../sme/docu-sme-preprocessor.html#ini) written for North
Saami.

Capitalization of whole words
-----------------------------

This has not yet been implemented.
