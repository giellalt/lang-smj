Introduction
============

This file describes the Lule Saami lexicon files. The documentation is
not complete. Status quo for the lexicon files is as follows (030310):

-   The inflection is more or less covered, with the following
    exceptions:
    -   Numerals are missing

The file structure for the lexicon files is the same as for the other
Saami lgs, cf. the [North Sámi
flowchart](../sme/docu-sme-flowchart.html).

The Nouns

The nouns are divided in the following sublexica (the noun-smj-lex.txt

NB! Note that grade III nouns of the biel'lo type must be added as such
in the lexicon, in order not to get wrong CG results. Also,
non-gradating nouns must go to different sublexica, and these lexica
must point to CG-free case sublexica.

The Adjectives

The adjective lexica follow Spiik's numbering system, in the following

The verbs
=========

Introduction
------------

Auxiliary verbs and main verbs are treated separately. Note the
concatenated entries for auxiliary + negation.

The main verbs are divided in even (-at, -åt, -ot, -et), odd (-it) and
contracted (-át, -åt\~ut, -it) stems.

The auxiliaries
---------------

The auxiliaries have the lexica NEG, ÅRROT, LIEHKET. The verb stems are
declared initially in the `verb-smj.txt` file, and the continuation
lexica themselves are declared towards the end of the `smj-lex.txt`
file. Since the auxiliaries are irregular, the suffixes are just listed.

The main verbs

### The disposition

The disposition is as follows:

1.  The stem class lexica and their immediate daughter lexica
    1.  Even-syllabic stems
        1.  Modals
        2.  Ordinary main verbs
    2.  Odd-syllabic stems
    3.  Contracted stems
2.  Main inflectional categories
3.  Intermediate suffix lexica
4.  Final suffix lexica
5.  Derivation

### Inflection

#### The stem class lexica

Each main stem type has its own section, for the lexica with pointers
from the verb file. These lecixa first split into a non-derivational and
a derivational part, with `BASSATStem` and `DeverbalVerbsBASSAT` (etc.,
for the other lexica). The latter point to the derivational lexica, cf.
next xection. The former is a set of lexica with pointers towards
passive (`EVENPASSIVE`) and non-passive (`BASSATINCH`) continuation
lexica.

The `BASSATINCH` etc. lexica point twice to `INFL-EVEN` etc., both
directly and via the inchoative `-goahte-` suffix.

#### The main inflectional categories

The `INFL-EVEN, INFL-o-, INFL-ODD, INFL-CONTR` lexica then point to the
different person-number sublexica. Note that there in Lule Saami are two
person-number suffix series. One is used in even-syllabic verbs for
present tense and in odd-syllabic verbs for past tense, this is named
with roman numeral I in the sublexica to follow. The other one is used
in even-syllabic verbs for past tense and potential, lexica with this
suffix set are named with roman numerals II. The reason for this
abstraction is that we do not need to write the same suffixes several
times, rather, we may refer to the same suffix set from different
stem-tense-mode combinations.

The pointers to the person-number lexica are done on blocks of nine and
nine.

#### The intermediate suffix lexica

Here, the person-number blocks are split in different groups, according
to morphophonological processes.

#### The final suffix lexica

At last, we are in a position to assign person-number suffixes.

### Derivation

The passive lexica add the passive suffixes, and thereafter point
further on to the inflection lexica.

The derivational system takes the North Saami system as a starting
point, but does not (yet) take transitivity into account.

From the stems of each stemtype, there are pointers to lexica

`DeverbalVerbsBASSAT,DeverbalVerbsJUHKAT,             DeverbalVerbsLÁHPPET, DeverbalNounsBASSAT,DeverbalNounsBASSALASSTET,             DeverbalVerbsBIEGGAT, DeverbalVerbsDIEHTET, DeverbalNounsDIEHTET,             DeverbalVerbsJÅLLÅRIT, DeverbalNounsJÅLLÅRIT,             DeverbalNounsMUJTATJIT, DeverbalVerbsVUORDDELIT,             DeverbalVerbsLASSÁNIT, DeverbalVerbsBIEKKASTIT, DeverbalNounsOADDÁT,             DeverbalVerbsOADDÁT, DeverbalNounsSTRÁFFUT,             DeverbalVerbsSJIERRIT`.

All these lexica are found in a separate section "Verbal derivation"
following the section on verbal inflection.

The closed classes
==================

Pronouns
--------

### Personal pronouns

Lule Saami personal pronouns are added to the file closed-smj.lex.txt.
They differ from the corresponding North Sami ones in having uniform
sublexica across the different persons. The initial lexicon *Personal*
splits into nine sublexica, 3 for each person, each pointing to one
sublexicon for each number. The 3 number sublexica (*persproncasesg*,
etc. then give the case forms.

### Demonstrative pronouns

This lexicon contains both declineable and indeclineable entries. The
declineable ones point to five sublexica, *dakkárcase, demcas,
juohkkahasjcase,* duobbacase and *dátcas*. Of these, the former splits
into number sublexica.

### Reflexive pronouns

In the *Reflexive* sublexicon, the reflexive pronoun *iesj* gets
spelled-out forms for the Px-less nominative, whereas the oblique forms
are directed to sublexica for sg and pl. There they get appropriate
stems, and the singular forms are redirected to the ordinary nominal Px
lexica. Acc PxSg1 and Gen PxSg1 have exceptional forms, they are listed
as such.

The plural reflexives do have deviating Px forms, they are listed in the
closed-smj-lex.txt file itself, first by establishing dual and plural
substems for each person (in the lexicon *PxCiPlstem*), and then by
giving the personal suffixes (in the lexicon *PxCPlstem.*).

### Reciprocal pronouns

Various cases of the word gasska with dual and plural Px-forms.

### Interrogative pronouns

These are *makkár/makkir, mij, guhtimusj,* *galla/galli, galles, goabbá*
and *guhti*. *Makkár/makkir* points to *dakkárcase* (demonstrative).
Some case-forms are idiosyncraticand are given separately.The rest are
generated in sublexa*.*

### Indefinite pronouns

These are a whole bunch. Typically the nominative sg. and one more case
(illative sg. or nominative pl. for example) are given separately, while
the other cases are generated in specific lexica. Indefinites that don´t
inflect are for example vehi and juohkka.

Subjunctions and Conjunctions
-----------------------------

10-20 subjunctions and conjunctions are listed, and given appropriate
tags.

Numerals
--------

The numeral lexica are formed as a generator, generating all possible
numerals. The basic lexicon is `Numeral`, and it looks like this:

LEXICON Numeral MILJON ; ! a noun of its own UNDERDUHAT ; ! for
generator under 1000 JUSTDUHAT ; ! going via 1000 OVERDUHAT ; ! for
generator over 1000 OLD ; ! for "thirteen hundred, etc. !num-ordinal ; !
The basic ordinal numbers !Integrated in card. !num-derived ; ! still
unimplemented num-imprecise ; ARABIC ; ! for the arabic numerals !^C^
ROMAN ; ! for the roman numerals !^C^ NUM-PREFIXES ; ! for §34 etc. !^C^
ISOLATED-NUMEXP ; ! for ½ etc. !^C^

MILJON is a noun. OLD is the old way of counting. num-ordinal act like
adjectives, they are not finished yet. ARABIC and ROMAN contain number
generators.

So, what is the reason for the three different lexica around 1000?

The reason is that the numeric system turns at the thousand mark.
Numbers above it and numbers below it behave in the same way, thus we
have both *twentyfour* and *twentyfourthousand*, etc.

The path is OVERDUHAT -&gt; JUSTDUHAT -&gt; UNDERDUHAT. OVERDUHAT
generates the part of the numeral that is over 1000, and all these
lexica then point to JUSTDUHAT. That lexicon has an optional "(one)
thousand" before it leads either to DUHAT and via the relevant case
paradigm to K, or to UNDERDUHAT. UNDERDUHAT contains the numerals 1-999.
UNDERDUHAT starts with the lexicon for one, and gives each group of
numerals its own lexicon.

Particles and Interjections
---------------------------

140-150 particles and interjections are listed, and given tags.

Adverbs
=======

The file adv-smj-lex.txt contains lexical adverbs. Still missing is
defect case paradigms, and adverbs derived from adjectives.

Adpositions
===========

The file differs between pre- and postpositions.
