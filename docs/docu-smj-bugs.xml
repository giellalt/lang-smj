      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Just as for North Sámi, this bug file is obsolete. Now, we
         document the Lule Saami bugs in <a href="http://giellatekno.uit.no/bugzilla/">Bugzilla</a>. This short text
         is kept here until we are sure that these bugs are fixed. The Px bug is
         treated elsewhere, but the treatment of diminutives must await a fuller
         treatment of derivation in Lule Sámi.
      </p>
      <h1>Bug reports, errors</h1>
      <h2>The Px problem</h2>
      <p>Of all Px-case combinations, some are generated, others are not.
         The smj-lex.txt file says "! ess &amp; ill pl do not use Px that
         often, left out". But there are more forms that are left out, and the
         coverage differs from stem class to stem class.
      </p>
      <p>These are not generated for muorra: Essive, and plural of Nom, Gen,
         Ill, Com.
      </p>
      <h2>Diminutives of odd-syllable nouns</h2>
      <p>They got the wrong stem input to DenominalNounsODD:</p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">gámas+N+Dim+N+Sg+Nom
gámas+N+Dim+N+Sg+Nom    gábmassj

gámas+N+Dim+N+Sg+Gen
gámas+N+Dim+N+Sg+Gen    gábmasttja
</pre>
      <p>An -a- was added before the Dim suffix. Check this!</p>
