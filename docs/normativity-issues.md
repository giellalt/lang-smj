Background
==========

The immediate background for this list is the meeting of the Lule Sámi
language board meeting. The list will be relevant also after this
meeting, though. It is a key document to the normativity issued faced by
the sámi spellchecker program, and lists open normativity issues.

Even and contracted stemtypes in nom. and gen./acc. when joined with pos. suffix
================================================================================

The normative grammars are far from precise in this issue with respect
to stem-vowel change and central consonant gradation in each case. We
are now using a system developed for the translation of the bible.

Loan word intergration
======================

What policy should be followed here? There are no normative decisions
made. The writers of Sámásta say that principles have been developed
over time, but the practice is unstable and there seems to be a whole
lot of confusion (s. 272 ff.). The book gives some suggestions of how to
incorporate loanwords, but there hasn't obviously been any normative
organ involved.

Dialect specific forms
======================

According to two main sources there are different ways of writing the
same word in Sweden an Norway. F.exs "luohttedahtte" and "kasus" in
Sweden and "luohtedahtte" and "kásus" in Norway. We have added both
forms, but this gives us some problems. If someone in Norway writes
"luohttedahtte", the speller doesn't mark it as red, even though the
usual form in Norway is "luohtedahtte". The same problem in Sweden, only
opposite. This meens that the speller doesn't correct words that are
written diffrently in Sweden and Norway, even though it's "wrong" .

Short froms
===========

Some words are beeing shortened f eks: riek (riekta)and guok(guokta).
"Tjuohte" is also beeing shortened into "tjuot", in compounds. To some
degree we can find these words beeing used in dictionaries and grammars.
Is it allowed to use these shortened forms in writing?

Case forms of abbreviation, acronyms and numerals
=================================================

Should the case form of abbreviation, acronyms and numerals be written
with colon, hyphen or apostroph? Example: **NRK:as** vs **NRK-as** vs
**NRK'as**

Should consonant-final abbreviation, acronyms and numerals spell out the
epenthetic -a- or not? Example: **NRK:s** vs **NRK:as**

Propername+noun
===============

How should various kinds of propernames be written? With hyphen
(Windows-prográmma, MEGA-bargge, Elle-áhkko, Finlandia-dåhpe,
Adidas-gáma, Oslo-biila, Vuona-ládde etc) or in another way (like Oslo
biila, Vuona ládde etc). Is it different for different kinds of
first-parts: place, organisation, personname, surname, object etc? Is it
different for different kinds of second parts?
