      <h1>Preprocessing the input</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h2>Tokenizing</h2>
      <h3>Obsolete: The tokenizer file tok.txt</h3>
      <p>Just as for North Sámi, the Lule Saami preprocessing was
         earlier done with the Xerox <em>tokenize</em> tool and the
         language-specific file tok.txt. The code itself is written as a set
         of regular expressions, and the source file (tok.txt) was compiled
         by xfst. As explained for the sme preprocessing, this approach was
         replaced by a preprocessor script, written in perl,
         <code>gt/script/preprocess</code>. 
      </p>
      <h3>The current preprocessor</h3>
      <p>Preprocessing is done by the perl script
         <code>gt/script/preprocess</code>, which is language-independent.
         The script is documented <a href="../../ling/preprocessor.html">here</a>. The language dependent
         part of the script shall be done via the file <code>smj/bin/abbr.txt</code></p>
      <h3>Handling abbreviations</h3>
      <p>Lule Saami abbreviations are handled as for North Saami.</p>
      <h2>Spell relaxation of æ/ä, ø/ö</h2>
      <p>This is a feature common to Lule and South Sami, not to be found
         in North Sami. The letter æ/ä and ø/ö are used interchangeably in
         Norway and Sweden. The parser accepts any version of
         them.
      </p>
      <p>The xfst file to handle this is the language-independent
         <a href="https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/gt/common/src/spellrelax.regex">spellrelax.regex</a>.
         It contains rules like:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">ń (-&gt;) ñ, ŋ (-&gt;) ñ, æ (-&gt;) ä, ø (-&gt;) ö ;</pre>
      <p>The line says that æ may optionally be replaced by ä and that ø may
         optionally be replaced with ö, and the same for the different ways of
         writing ŋ.
      </p>
      <p>
         We plan to make parts of the spellrelax file language dependent.
         
      </p>
      <h2>Initial capitalization</h2>
      <p>There is a language independent <a href="https://gtsvn.uit.no/langtech/trunk/gt/common/src/inituppercase.regex">inituppercase.regex</a> file. Cf. <a href="../sme/docu-sme-preprocessor.html#ini">the documentation for
            initial capitalization</a> written for North Saami.
      </p>
      <h2>Capitalization of whole words</h2>
      <p>This has not yet been implemented.</p>
